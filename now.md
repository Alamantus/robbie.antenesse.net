This is Robbie's [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about), which he tries to keep updated within a few months
of things changing (but no promises). It contains assorted personal projects and accomplishments as well as
more professional ones.

This page was last updated on March 5, 2024.

Aside from his ongoing responsibilities of full-time work at [Touchstone IQ](https://touchstoneiq.com) and taking care of his 3 dogs,
Robbie has several projects from several interests going.

## Tech

- Maintaining & supporting [Feather Wiki](https://feather.wiki)
    - Fixing bugs and writing extensions
- Developed & released [siteleteer](https://alamantus.codeberg.page/siteleteer/)
    - Probably not a lot more to add to it moving forward...
- Set up a home server for running [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) for myself
    - Using [Yattee](https://github.com/yattee/yattee) to play from my apple devices has been a major game-changer!

## Games

- Working on an update to [The GUTS+ System](https://guts.plus)
    - It's a big one that involves changing some of the main words and adding more clarity for game masters.
- Started playing [Tunic](https://tunicgame.com) on the Switch
    - Super interesting game design and awesome interconnected map design!

## Home

- Started learning to make yarn and crochet
    - Got a Humble Bundle full of books, now I just need the tools to make things...
- Training my new puppy
    - She's adorable and extremely good for a puppy, but she's still a puppy with lots to learn...!
