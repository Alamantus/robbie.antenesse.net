Time-to-Page is a calculator that converts listened audiobook time to the equivalent
page in the physical book and vice-versa. It was originally built very simply and barebones,
but I re-wrote it in React, Redux, and Bootstrap to show my skills in those technologies while
also adding some extra features to make it a little bit nicer to use like saving book settings
and measuring by percent completion in addition to time and page number.

This app is second most used that I have made with at least 2 visitors per day without fail
since it has been online, and it is mostly accessed via Google searches! It turns out that
this is a tool that people have needed, and in at least one case, it has been used as the
main tool for calculating page number in a reading challenge on GoodReads!

It is built with React, Redux, and Bootstrap, and it is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Alamantus/time-to-page).
