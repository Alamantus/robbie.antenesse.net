Lexiconga is a free tool that makes it fast and easy build dictionaries for constructed
languages. Users can specify details about their language, link between word definitions,
customize the appearance of their dictionary, and even share their creations publicly!
It's much lighter and faster than similar services, and it doesn't track user data.

This web app takes an offline-first approach to handling dictionary data, storing it
exclusively in the user's browser and only calling the server when they log in with an account.
All functionality is available without an account, and without an account, all
functionality is still available without internet access using [UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/).

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, Sass styling, a straight PHP backend, and a MySQL server,
and it is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Alamantus/Lexiconga).
