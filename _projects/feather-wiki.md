Feather Wiki is a tiny app for creating self-contained wikis, notebooks, or other non-linear, iner-linked
content. It is delivered in a single HTML file that can be loaded in any modern browser, and it outputs
any content created using it into a new HTML file that also contains the whole Feather Wiki application.
It was built to be like [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) in functionality but with the goal of keeping
the file size for the project as small as possible. While TiddlyWiki has more features by default than
Feather Wiki, Feather Wiki exposes all of its internal methods to the browser window, enabling nearly
infinite possibilities for extending its functionality.

It is built with Choo in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it is
[open source on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Alamantus/FeatherWiki).
