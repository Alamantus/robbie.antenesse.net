While researching around templating software to make my life easier, I found that there is a large demand for AngularJS developers, so I decided that it would be a great skill to build.<br>After struggling to build the website from scratch for a while, I decided that using Bootstrap and Sass to style the site would be the best use of my time instead. I thought of a design that would be nice for both large and small screens and started researching how to get it done.<br>In the end, I came up with what you see now.",

I liked the idea and expanded the game concept from there. What if players were trying to receive messages from space and in the end unknowingly were communicating with each other?<br>I started working on the game at the start of the jam by creating the 3D models with Blender for the game and then extrapolating the UI from how the models ended up looking. Then I moved to coding with C# and made the stars viewed through the periscope generate in a grid with random offsets and sizes. I ran into trouble getting the knobs in the radio UI to turn, but was able to figure it out by manipulating the sprite's angle directly and using the angle value to set desired radio stations.<br>I was also able to layer multiple text UI elements to give the effect of translating coded messages letter by letter. It took a good deal of trouble to get it working properly, but eventually I just forced it to work by simplifying some code I had previously overthought.",
