title: More About Robbie

### Professionally...

I'm a web developer who specializes in JavaScript front end development and PHP + MySQL back end development with a
growing interest in NodeJS back end apps.

My experience with JavaScript includes a number of popular tools and frameworks like Webpack, React, Redux,
jQuery, and more and some less popular ones that I prefer like Parcel Bundler, Choo, and Inferno JS, among others.
I pride myself in the fact that the depth of my JavaScript knowledge enables me to quickly learn any new frameworks
or libraries that I might be required to learn in any given situation.

While I am primarily focused on front end development, most of my work requires a back end, so I have collected a
lot of experience in that realm as well. My back end experience includes a variety of technologies like plain
object-oriented PHP, NodeJS, Apache & NginX, custom databases & SQL, and more. These technologies have exposed me
to tools like Wordpress, ModX, FlightPHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Express JS, Certbot and much more.

### Personally...

I'm a hobby game developer, linguistics enthusiast, conlang creator, home owner, dog parent, and casual gamer.

I create games for both the computer and the tabletop. Most of the computer games I've made have been the results
of short-term game jams, but the tabletop games I've worked on have generally been longer term projects driven by
passion. The majority of my games are available on [my Itch.io page](https://alamantus.itch.io), and I also keep my
now-dormant [game development advice and inspiration blog](https://alamantus.com) online as something of an
archive for its valuable information and encouragement. I also have a Mastodon account where I write about
games in general and share interesting things I find on [Tabletop.Social](https://tabletop.social/@Alamantus).

Aside from games, I also develop constructed languages (conlangs) and keep a [blog for Lexiconga](https://blog.lexicon.ga)
that posts and reblogs conlang ideas and inspiration. I have yet another Mastodon account on [Polyglot.City](https://polyglot.city/@Alamantus)
where I post about linguistics, conlanging, and the occasional Biblical Hebrew translation.

If you search the web for either "Robbie Antenesse" or my preferred user handle "Alamantus", the results will most
likely be related to me in some way! My primary Mastodon account is [@Alamantus@cybre.space](https://cybre.space/@Alamantus);
I'm on GitHub as [Alamantus](https://github.com/Alamantus), Reddit as [Alamantus](https://reddit.com/user/alamantus),
and even Keybase as [alamantus](https://keybase.io/alamantus); and I'm pretty sure that I'm the only
"Robbie Antenesse" alive on earth.

If you see me around the internet, feel free to say hello!
